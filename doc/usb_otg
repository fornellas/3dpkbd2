22.5.2 Peripheral states
	Powered state
		Vbus detects power
			SRQINT bit in OTG_FS_GINTSTS
			Expects reset signaling
				USBRST in OTG_FS_GINTSTS
			Reset complete
				ENUMDNE bit in OTG_FS_GINTSTS
				Enters Default state
		Vbus detects no power
			SEDET bit in OTG_FS_GOTGINT
	Soft disconnect
		From powered state, device can trigger soft disconnect
			SDIS bit in OTG_FS_DCTL
	Default state
		Expects to receive SET_ADDRESS
		Writes received address to
			DAD bit in OTG_FS_DCFG
			Enters addressed state
	Suspended state
		3ms of USB idleness, early suspend interrupt
			ESUSP bit in OTG_FS_GINTSTS
		3ms later, suspend confirmed
			USBSUSP bit in OTG_FS_GINTSTS
			Device suspend bit set
			SUSPSTS bit in OTG_FS_DSTS
		Maybe exited by the device via remote wakeup
			Set RWUSIG bit in OTG_FS_DCTL
			Clear 1-15ms later
		When resume signaling detected from host
			WKUPINT bit in OTG_FS_GINTSTS




- 3ms of USB idleness
	ESUSP bit set in OTG_FS_GINTSTS (early suspend)
	3ms later
	USBSUSP bit set in OTG_FS_GINTSTS (suspend confirmed)
	SUSPSTS bit set in OTG_FS_DSTS
	OTG_FS enters suspended state

- Suspend exit
	- By device remote wakeup by setting RWUSIG bit in OTG_FS_DCTL
		- And clearing after 1-15ms.
	- Resume signaling from host
		WKUPINT bit is set in OTG_FS_GINTSTS
		suspend bit is cleared
